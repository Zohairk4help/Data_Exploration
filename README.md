# Data_Exploration
This repo contains the files that show my skills on data cleaning, visualisation, wrangling and exploration. 

Data exploration is the process of examining and understanding a dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. It is the first step in the data science process and involves using tools like pandas to clean, transform, and visualize the data.


Data science, on the other hand, is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves various steps, such as data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment, to solve complex problems in areas like machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.
